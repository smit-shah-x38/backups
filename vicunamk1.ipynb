ASSISTANT: Quantum computing is a type of computing that takes advantage of quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once, rather than just a binary 0 or 1 like traditional bits. This is known as superposition. By using superposition, quantum computers can perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers. For example, a quantum computer can factor large numbers exponentially faster than a classical computer. Additionally, quantum computers can also take advantage of another quantum property called entanglement to perform certain operations faster than classical computers.\n",
